# restaurant
keeps track of menu items, inventory, and purchases
This app is ideal for restaurant owners as it gives them a tool to record recipes, menu items, inventory, purchases, and profits. It allows users to create, 
update and delete: menu items, recipe requirements, and ingredients from inventory. It also allows for entering purchases which are kept in a log. 
Revenues and costs of menu items sold are tracked on a separate page along with calculated profits.
